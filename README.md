html5doc
========

Html5Doc lets you store and retrieve document objects from local storage.  Of course, this is something that is fairly easy to do already, so why would you use Html5Docs? 

* It adds a little bit of structure with the idea of document object stores, which allows you to easily group your documents by type, user, or whatever your implementation requires.
* It provides safety from compatibility issues by catching exceptions and returning boolean success values.
* It also provides a separate test method for browser compatibility.
